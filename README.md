Coursera Course Machine Learning Foundations from University of Washington
============================================================================

Unofficial repository for Coursera's Machine Learning Foundations course from University of Washington. All data are downloaded from the course.
However, instead of using graphlab, which requires license, I am using numpy + pandas + sklean to rewrite it. During rewriting, I am learning machine learning knowledge myself -- and hopefully this repository can help you get started with machine learning as well.

## Get Started
1. Go to [Coursera](www.coursera.org) and enroll in Machine Learning Foundations from University of Washington.
2. Install Python 3 (Python 3.5 or higher recommended). Install requirements listed in requirements.txt via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow videos, lecture notes and study concepts. And play along with notebooks to get some practices!

## Why This Repo
1. Machine learning is a very hot topic now and it can solve some data problem that are hard to be solved traditionally. So I want to learn some statistics and machine learning.
2. This course takes a practical approach -- this is different from Andrew Ng's famous course in machine learning and I like to see results and then get interested in learning the magic behind.
3. However, this course is based on graphlab -- it is for commercial and academic use only. In industry people use numpy + scipy + pandas + sklearn a lot. So I think why not rewrite the courses in the popular Python data tech stack. So instead of a repo like the one provided during the course or [Example](https://github.com/MaxPoon/coursera-Machine-Learning-specialization/tree/master/Machine-Learning-Foundations-A-Case-Study-Approach) or [Example](https://github.com/tjaskula/Coursera/tree/master/Specializations/Machine%20Learning/Machine%20Learning%20Foundations%20A%20Case%20Study%20Approach), this repo relies on open source popular tools in data science.
